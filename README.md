# CSC414-Programs
programs for the CSC 414 class

CSC414_Stubbing_Project - 
This folder contains all of the files associated with the stubbing project. I'm leaving them grouped as a single cohesive file, as they are stored when using VisualStudio.
The direct .cpp file can be found in the second CSC414_Stubbing_Project file. The file collection also contains a collection of screenshots showing the results of my software
tests. The important tests have been renamed and fortmatted for easy view, but I included the tests for all of the menu options (they just became a bit redundant to take the 
effort to edit).
